IA causes a good impression while it is presented to other people, but very few of them knows the process behind that “magic”, which in this report a basic IA will be implemented in order to achieve the task to Generate a human face but the interesting thing is that the generated face must be fake and try to trick the human mind in order to generate a face that would look real for their interpretation. 
# HOW GAN WORKS
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the most popular topics in Deep Learning and they are types of Neural Networks used for Unsupervised learning. If this acronym was analyzed by words, the Generative part refers to a network that is constantly generating data and for the Adversarial part involves two opposite networks and the Network word refers to the data that is ahead and generates new data.
So there are two networks, one that acts as the generator and their task will be to generate fake images from a dataset and the other network will act as a discriminator that will determine whether an image is real or fake, thus both networks will fight between them in order to whether the generator tries to trick the discriminator while the discriminator will try to always determine that each image made by the generator is fake. So, this competition will be analyzed along the development of this report.
